The objective of Rock, Paper, Scissors is to choose which of the three options will defeat your opponent's choice.

Rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, and paper defeats rock.

In a game version, the program's choice must be truly random.  The best way to accomplish this is to randomly generate a number (1-3) and assign each value to a choice.

A user will have to enter their selection.  This could be achieved by either clicking one of three buttons or typing in their selection.  Typing would mean the input would have to be recorded as a string and made upper/lowercase to keep things consistent.

The game will need to report the winner (and why).  It would be good to track score as well.

For my game, I want to do Fire, Water, Grass rather than Rock, Paper, Scissors.  All three have a strength and weakness, so it will be an easy translation.  Eventually, I can use decals/images to enhance the game further.
